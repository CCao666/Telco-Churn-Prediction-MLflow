## 🎯 Project Goal

The objective of this project is to build a production-style churn prediction system that:

- Identifies customers at high risk of cancellation  
- Handles class imbalance in a principled way  
- Compares multiple model families  
- Tracks experiments using MLflow  
- Selects and registers the best-performing model  
- Optimizes decision thresholds for business tradeoffs  

Unlike a simple notebook-based modeling exercise, this project demonstrates a structured ML lifecycle workflow:

**EDA → Preprocessing → Multi-model comparison → Hyperparameter tuning → Model selection → Registry**

The final production candidate is an optimized, class-weighted **XGBoost** model, tuned to balance churn detection and intervention cost.
